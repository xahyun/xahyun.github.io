            <h2>Positions</h2>

            <div class="dropdown">

                <button onclick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn">Middle Blocker</button>
                <div class="dropdown-content myDropdown">
                    <p>Middle blockers are the team’s best blockers, and they hit mostly fast-tempo sets from the middle of the court and behind the setter.
                    Typically the libero goes in for the middle when he or she rotates to the back row. 
                    Middle sets are some of the most difficult to set and require good passes, therefore middles often get the fewest sets but have the best hitting percentages.</p>
                </div>

                <button onclick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn">Setters</button>
                <div class="dropdown-content myDropdown">
                    <p>A setter’s primary responsibility is to take the second ball and set it up for one of the hitters to attack. 
                    Often referred to as the quarterback, the setter is the decision maker of the team and is in charge of leading the offense.
                    In a 6-1, the setter plays all the way around, meaning that he or she has defensive responsibilities, as well as blocking duties when in the front row.
                    A setter’s responsibilities include setting the ball on the second contact to the hitters on the court, directing the offense, playing right-back defense, and blocking the other team’s outside hitter.</p>
                </div>

                <button onclick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn">Libero</button>
                <div class="dropdown-content myDropdown">
                    <p>Liberos wear a jersey of a different color and play in the back row five out the six rotations, usually subbing in for both middle blockers. When the libero comes in for another player, it does not count as a substitution.
                        Liberos are defensive and serve-receive specialists who are typically fast and are able to change direction quickly. 
                    Liberos are not permitted to attack the ball from above the height of the net, and they can only overhand set a front-row attacker from behind the 10-foot line.</p>
                </div>

                <button onclick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn">Opposite Hitter</button>
                <div class="dropdown-content myDropdown">
                    <p>Opposite hitters earned that title because they are opposite to the strong (left) side hitter, meaning they hit behind the setter.
                        In a 6-1, just like an outside hitter, an opposite has the option to play all the way around, passing, playing defense, and hitting out of the back row.
                        An opposite’s responsibilities include swinging from the front and back row, playing right-back defense, and blocking the other team’s outside hitter.</p>
                </div>

                <button onclick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn">Outside Hitter</button>
                <div class="dropdown-content myDropdown">
                    <p>An outside hitter hits and blocks from the left side of the court. 
                    Normally, they also carry the responsibilities of passing and playing defense when they get to the back row. 
                    The outside typically gets the most sets, especially when the setter is out of system, due to the fact that the outside set is one of the easier options to set. 
                    An outside’s responsibilities include hitting from the front and back row, passing in serve receive, playing left or middle-back defense, and blocking.</p>
                </div>

                <button onclick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn">Defense Specialists</button>
                <div class="dropdown-content myDropdown">
                    <p>Much like a libero, a defensive specialist plays in the back row and is responsible for playing defense and receiving serve. 
                    Unlike the libero, they do not wear different colored jerseys and are required to abide by the normal substitution rules, meaning they are only in for three out of the six rotations.

                    <p>An indoor volleyball match is the best of five games. The team who takes the majority (three games) is the overall winner of the match.</p>
                    <p>To win a game, a team must score 25 points with a two-point difference. </p> 
                    <p>If they’re too closely matched, the game can continue over the 25-point maximum.</p> 
                    <p>On the final deciding game of the match it’s only played until 15 points, but the two-point difference still applies.</p>

                        <p>The setter is the playmaker in volleyball.</p> 
                        <p>They prepare the ball so it’s well-placed for an attacker to shoot and score a point for their team.</p> 
                        <p>Overhead setting is when a player places both their hands above their forehead, creating a triangle shape with their thumbs and index fingers.</p> 
                        <p>They push the ball up with their fingers, with the attacker ready to take their shot.</p>

                        <h4>Spiking: </h4>
                        <p>This is one of the most impressive-looking moves in the game.</p>
                        <p>A spike is generally when a player runs, jumps and hits the ball over the net with a powerful swing. </p>
                        <p>Usually this is a move for an attacker or shooter, as these big hits usually win points.</p>
                        <p>If you’re a beginner, try to avoid spiking until you can maintain a long rally.</p>

                        <p>A block is a defensive move used at the net. When an attacker moves to shoot,</p>
                        <p>a maximum of three players on the other team come close to the net and jump just after the attacker with their arms up.</p>
                        <p>When the ball comes over the net, it’ll be blocked by the players and either move into their side or back towards the opposing team.</p>
